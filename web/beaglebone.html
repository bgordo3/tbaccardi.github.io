    <h3>Beaglebone Black</h3>
    <p>The Beaglebone Black is a cool little Linux computer that has a lot of room for robotics and web services and things of that nature. I've played around with it to try to learn the basics of the Linux operating system (or rather the Linux kernel and the Debian operating system).

    <p>The Beaglebone Black is a big technological jump forward from the Arduino. Everything about the platform makes it a more capable platform for robotics and processor-intesive applications (with a few exceptions). </p>
    <p>The Beaglebone is build by Texas Instruments and uses the ARM AM-335xx Cortex A8 processor. The board has 512MB of RAM and a processor speed of 1GHz, with 4GB of storage onboard the eMMC. The board has a micro HDMI port for connecting to a display, a USB port, a mini-USB port (which can also be used for supplying power to the board or connecting to it with <i>internet over usb</i>), and a micro hdmi card slot.</p>
    <p>Undoutably, the BBB will be compared to similar boards, such as the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi has advantages in the number of usb ports (2 for the orignal, 4 for the Raspberry Pi 2), graphics support (the Raspberry Pi VideoCore IV processor can decode 1080p video streams, while the BBB PowerVR SGX530 can't natively handle 1080p), and special-case peripherals (an optional camera module can be purchased for the Pi which streams black-and-white video by default. This is a pro for computer vision applications, as most applications will require a BW image for processing. The camera also supports a high framerate and easy integration). However, the Beaglebone Black has been recognized as a better platform for robotics, in no small part due to the huge number of GPIO pins. The Raspberry Pi only has 8 GPIOs, while the Beaglebone has 69 GPIOs (confirm) and 7 ADCs.
