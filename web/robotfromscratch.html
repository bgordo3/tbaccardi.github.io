    <p>This is a video of a home-made differential drive robot I made for a design project in a class while back.</p>
    <p>It basically consisted of an Arduino microcontroller on a custom 3D printed frame with some gearmotors withsome Hall Effect encoders. The code is linked <a href="/Users/Burns/Documents/web/rcrobot.ino" download>here</a>, in case anyone is interestedi.

    <h3>Beaglebone Black</h3>
    <p>The Beaglebone Black is a cool little Linux computer that has a lot of room for robotics and web services and things of that nature. I've played around with it to try to learn the basics of the Linux operating system (or rather the Linux kernel and the Debian operating system).
